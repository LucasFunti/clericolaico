  "hero.subtitle.paragraph.1": "Every two years, the Greek community of South America gathers in a unique and significant clerical-lay event. This meeting brings together Greeks from various countries in the region to reflect on their identity and strengthen community bonds. Over several days, participants enjoy a rich agenda of cultural, religious, and festive activities that not only celebrate Greek heritage but also promote coexistence and dialogue between generations.",
  "hero.subtitle.paragraph.2": "This year, the event will take place in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in November, and promises to be an unforgettable experience. In addition to reflections and festivities, a vote will be held to determine the venue for the next meeting, which will be held in São Paulo, Brazil. This democratic aspect of the event ensures that all community members have a voice in future planning, thus strengthening unity and active participation of all Greeks in South America.",

The themes of these debate tables are based on the discussions of the plenaries held at the clerical-lay reunion in Montevideo. In this way, the continuation, monitoring, and follow-up of the evolution of reflection and, above all, the implementation of the proposed ideas are guaranteed.",
